# Cart Page README

This repository contains the implementation of a Cart Page with basic features like adding items, deleting items, and calculating the total cost. The cart page is a part of a web application and is currently under development.HTML and CSS files obtained from the [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM). I further practiced and added JavaScript functionalities to enhance the cart page's interactivity.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Users can add items to their shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button next to each product on the product page. The cart page will display the added items along with their details such as name, price, and quantity.

- **Delete Items:** If users decide to remove an item from their cart, they can click the "Delete" button next to that item on the cart page. The item will be removed from the cart, and the total cost will be updated accordingly.

- **Total Cost:** The cart page will display the total cost of all the items in the cart. This value will be updated in real-time whenever items are added or removed from the cart.

- **Increase Quantity:** This feature is not yet implemented, but it will allow users to increase the quantity of a specific item in the cart. Currently, the quantity can only be set to one when the item is added.

## Development

The development of this Cart Page was inspired by the tutorial from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM). The tutorial provides valuable insights into building the cart page, and some parts of the code were created following the concepts and guidelines explained in the tutorial.

In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the cart page. However, I also coded some parts independently to suit the specific needs of the web application I am building.

As mentioned earlier, the feature to increase the quantity of items in the cart is not yet coded. I plan to implement this feature in the near future by adding event listeners and handling user input appropriately.

## How to Use

To use the cart page in your web application, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project. Make sure to link the stylesheets and scripts properly.

3. Integrate the cart page with your product page by adding the "Add to Cart" buttons for each product, and ensure they trigger the appropriate JavaScript functions to add items to the cart.

4. Create a cart container on your cart page where the added items will be displayed along with their details.

5. Implement the "Delete" functionality by adding event listeners to the delete buttons of each item in the cart.

6. Update the total cost dynamically whenever an item is added or deleted from the cart.

7. (Future work) Implement the "Increase Quantity" functionality to allow users to change the quantity of items in the cart.
